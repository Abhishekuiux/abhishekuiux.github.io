    <li>Design knowledge is very crucial for an iOS developer as the Apple’s App Store approval process scrutinizes based on the design aesthetics. In order to avoid such a situation it is recommended to go through the guidelines. So far, we have learned the following:</li>
    <br>
    <li>Learning iOS guidelines for the dimensions of different iPhone devices such Apple 5s, 6s, 6s plus, 7s and 7s Plus.</li>

  <h4>Why not just create any button?</h4>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Buttons play a major role in iOS App design. Every button has a particular purpose, and if your design does not reflect as per the iOS design guidelines, there are high chances that your app will get rejected at the App store. You will also get to identify if a button design meets the guidelines or not. This unit will let you think twice on the screens that you have designed are either good enough for submission to the app store or need to re-iterate.</li>

  <h4>Principle</h4>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>App development is a time taking process. Design and development are very crucial in this process. If the app is not well designed at the first place, the time spent on coding is all gone to waste as it's likely to get rejected by the app store. Thus, Apple has provided the interface guidelines for its developers to let developers understand the basic guidelines which could save ample time for themselves as well as the reviewers at Apple. For example, if the app does not use the system provided items like the button sizes and icons, it is more likely to get rejected.</li>
    <br>
    <li>A good button should follow the iOS guidelines for button.</li>
